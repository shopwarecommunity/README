# Submitting Proposals

You have an amazing idea for a new feature or plugin for Shopware? 
We'd love to collaborate with you on that!

Please submit your ideas as [Issues in this repo](https://github.com/shopwarecommunity/README/issues).
Once submitted it will appear in the "Open For Votes" column of the [Project Proposals](https://github.com/shopwarecommunity/README/projects/1).
Here, community members can vote to contribute to a project, ask for clarification or add to your proposal.

Proposals with enough critical mass (5 votes or more by Organisation Members) will pass on to Accepted.
At this stage, we create a repository and project under the organisation on GitHub, and the planning starts.
It is important at this stage you, the proposer, take the lead as project manager or assign someone in that role, to write out what needs to be done in a project.

Once work starts we will move the proposal to "In Progress".
